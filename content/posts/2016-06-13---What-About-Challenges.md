Have you been challenging yourself lately? What do you want to accomplish? Do you wanna be in a better position, become a better person? That’s good. Are you in movement to make this happen?

I would say there are many people that likes being stable, and i have nothing against it. But also there are many people that can’t stop until feeling anxious/nervous again.

What happens if you stay more than 2, 3 years in the same job ?
It’s possible that sometimes you’ll get bored, but then comes a new project and you get motivated again, that’s the cycle. The problem with this cycle is: There’s none. But If you allow this loop, you can enter in your comfort zone, and don’t even notice it.

It’s up to you to decide if you think it's the right path or not. What about trying another thing ? Something that scares you. I mean, if you already have dependents and many situations that need your stability, you need to be careful. Otherwise, why not ?

And this is not just about work.

- What about calling that pretty girl/boy out ?
- What about help someone you’ve never seem before ?
- What about trying to apologize even if it was not your fault ?
- What about say hi to someone that is looking at you ?
- What about ?
